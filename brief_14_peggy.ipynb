Each of the major market indexes has gained more than 20% from their respective trough. Perhaps more importantly, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are within striking distance of new highs, which will check the final box marking the start of a new bull market.\\nClosing out the old and ringing in the new is a great time for examination, and one of the places I start is with my portfolio. A review of my top investments and how they came to be that way can offer valuable insight for the future.\\nHere\\'s a look at my six largest holdings heading into 2024 (as of the market close on Dec. 15) and the incredibly valuable lesson I learned from each one.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nNo. 6: Nvidia\\nEvery investor has one -- the \"stock that got away.\" The one you meant to buy, only to find that it got away from you and has risen 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. In my case, that stock was Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). I had owned a few shares of the graphics processing units (GPU) pioneer in the early days of my investing journey but ultimately sold them in an unprovoked bid of tax-loss harvesting in early 2010.\\nI always meant to buy it back, but the stock price meandered for much of the next five years, and I ultimately lost confidence. Things changed quickly in 2016 when the stock tripled. After that, it just kept getting away from me.\\nFast forward to early 2018. Nvidia still dominated the discrete desktop GPU space, controlling roughly 70% of the market. The company\\'s graphics cards were the processor of choice for cryptocurrency mining, which was booming. Furthermore, there was an ongoing push toward autonomous driving. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for skating to where the puck was going -- recognizing technology trends on the fly and adapting Nvidia\\'s processors and the accompanying software to meet that need.\\nAfter much deliberation, I held my nose and bought Nvidia anyway -- even though the stock had risen 600% over the preceding two years. I have added to my stake several times since. Over the past few years, Nvidia has once again adapted to meet a compelling technology need, becoming the gold standard for generative AI applications.\\nSince that initial purchase, Nvidia has soared 768%, and the stock has become my sixth-largest holding, amounting to nearly 6% of my portfolio. The lesson here? It\\'s never too late to buy a quality company, even if the stock has already risen many times over.\\nNo. 5 and 4: Shopify and Amazon\\nLong after Amazon had established itself as the world\\'s largest digital retailer, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) came on the scene with a different approach to e-commerce. Shopify\\'s founders, having discovered firsthand the difficulties inherent in starting an online sales platform, pivoted the business from selling snowboards to providing customizable templates and other tools that made setting up and running an e-commerce business a snap.\\nBy solving a common problem among digital retailers, Shopify carved out a profitable niche for itself in a market that was already (and still is) dominated by Amazon. While it isn\\'t an exact apples-to-apples comparison, it helps illustrate an age-old truth in investing that I learned from owning this stock -- there\\'s a Pepsi for every Coke.\\nThere\\'s another lesson here. I had long been a shareholder of Amazon, but I recognized the value Shopify could bring to the online sales space. Despite the fact that e-commerce was already well represented in my portfolio, I made a sizable investment in Shopify.\\nThat decision turned out well, as both companies have continued to prosper in the age of digital retail. It also turned out well for me as an investor. Since my first purchase of Shopify shares, the stock is up more than 1,446%, while Amazon has gained 844%. Shopify and Amazon are my fourth and fifth largest holdings heading into 2024, each representing roughly 6% of my portfolio.\\nNo. 3: Apple\\nThere\\'s little question that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become one of the most successful companies in history. Yet, at times over the past few years, some investors concluded the company had reached its zenith. Apple reached a market cap of $1 trillion in 2018, so how much higher could it go?\\nThere were other worries. As penetration has risen, global smartphone sales have slowed. Since Apple\\'s flagship product -- the iPhone -- historically generates more than half the company\\'s revenue, investor reservations are understandable.\\nDespite these challenges, Apple has continued to grow. CEO Tim Cook has succeeded in expanding Apple\\'s services business to become the company\\'s second-biggest breadwinner, behind just the iPhone. The segment brought in $85 billion in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), making it comparable to a top 50 company in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, the iPhone continues to dominate where it matters, capturing a record 45% of worldwide smartphone revenue and 85% of profits in the second quarter, according to Counterpoint Research.\\nFears that Apple simply couldn\\'t go any higher turned out to be unfounded, an important lesson for investors as its market cap has tripled since 2018. Since my first purchase in 2008, Apple\\'s stock price has surged more than 3,400% to become my third-largest position at 8% of my portfolio. I\\'m confident there\\'s more to come.\\nNo. 2: Mercadolibre\\nIt\\'s likely that many investors have never heard of MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI). The company, which began as a local online auction site, has evolved into the largest e-commerce and payments ecosystem in Latin America, serving 18 countries in the region.\\nMercadoLibre not only provides a marketplace for buyers and sellers but also handles shipping and logistics, warehouse and cross-docking, digital payments, consumer and merchant financing, digital wallets, and more. Think of it as the Amazon, Shopify, and PayPal of Latin America all rolled into one.\\nMany investors have avoided the stock because of the risks inherent in the region, which is understandable. For example, Argentina -- MercadoLibre\\'s birthplace and one of its biggest markets -- has an inflation rate that clocks in at 143%, and the country just devalued its currency by 50%. Other countries in the region grapple with hyperinflation, economic turmoil, charges of political corruption, poor infrastructure, and more.\\nYet those risks pale in the context of the opportunity. Latin America is years behind the U.S. in terms of e-commerce and digital payment penetration, yet adoption continues to grow. Furthermore, Latin America has twice the population of the U.S. and is the fastest-growing e-commerce market in the world, according to Americas Market Intelligence. Finally, because MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction, it has sidestepped many of those risks. As a result, its revenue grew 50% in 2022 while net income soared 480%, a trend that has been ongoing for more than a decade.\\nUnderstanding the risk, viewed through the lens of the significant long-term opportunity, can provide important insight, which gave me the confidence to buy the stock. My rather modest initial investment in MercadoLibre in 2009 has grown by more than 7,300%, and the company now represents 10% of my portfolio. Not bad for a \"risky\" stock.\\nNo. 1: Netflix\\nNetflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought when I started investing in late 2007. After incurring a late fee at Blockbuster (remember them?) that was more than the cost of buying the movie new, I cut up my membership card and subscribed to Netflix. As an extremely satisfied customer, it made perfect sense to buy the stock once I started investing.\\nBack then, the company was a DVD-by-mail service that had recently begun experimenting with streaming video. Netflix had achieved remarkable penetration in its earliest markets, and I surmised the company could expand its success across the country, which was the basis of my investing thesis.\\nThe company has achieved all that and more, becoming the world\\'s largest subscription streaming video service. The value of the initial shares I bought in 2007 has surged more than 19,000%, making Netflix my largest holding at nearly 11% of my portfolio.\\nHowever, those life-changing gains were only possible because I held the stock for the duration, which is easier said than done. Remember the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011? All the \"Netflix killers\" over the years? How about the loss of 1.2 million subscribers early last year?\\nThere were plenty of excuses to sell Netflix over the years, but for me, the investing thesis never changed, so I held on. And this long-term buy-and-hold strategy continues to win out.\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn\\'t one of them.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock\\'s price, but are they really important?\\nLet\\'s take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.71 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\\nOf the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 58.6% and 10.3% of all recommendations.\\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AAPL\\n\\n\\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>\\n\\nThe ABR suggests buying Apple, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock\\'s future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock\\'s near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\\nIs AAPL a Good Investment?\\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.56.\\nAnalysts\\' steady views regarding the company\\'s earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.

NVIDIA also achieved a massive milestone in May 2023 by joining the exclusive club of companies with a $1 trillion market capitalization.\\nThe surge reflects investors\\' confidence in NVIDIA\\'s strategic positioning, robust financial performance and pivotal role in shaping transformative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and data center solutions.\\nHowever, the looming question remains — Can NVIDIA sustain this momentum through 2024?\\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus\\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\\nWill GenAI Investments Aid NVDA’s Surge?\\nNVIDIA’s robust stock price performance has been primarily driven by hopes that the company will be a prime beneficiary of growing investments in generative AI. Given generative AI’s inherited opportunities and the company’s leadership in the space, we believe the NVDA stock is poised to carry the momentum in 2024.\\nNVIDIA dominates the market for AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.\\nThe growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $109.37 billion by 2030, according to a new report by Grand View Research. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 35.6% from 2023 to 2030.\\nHowever, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\\nNVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA’s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\\nThe generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. Considering surging AI investments across the data center end market, NVDA expects its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $20 billion from $6.05 billion in the year-ago quarter.\\nAdditionally, NVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Growth Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.\\nOther Stocks in the $1T Club\\nApart from NVIDIA, only four companies — Apple Inc. AAPL, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN — have a market cap of more than $1 trillion at present. AAPL has the highest market cap of $3.05 trillion, followed by MSFT’s $2.77 trillion, GOOGL’s $1.71 trillion and AMZN’s $1.59 trillion. At yesterday’s closing price of $500.77, NVDA has a market capitalization of $1.23 trillion, positioning it in the fifth spot.\\nShares of Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon have rallied 50.7%, 55.4%, 53.9% and 83.2%, respectively, year to date.

It has to be Artificial Intelligence (AI), right?\\nNo other subject dominated the headlines quite like AI. Whether it was ChatGPT, viral AI-generated images, or the failed ouster of Sam Altman at OpenAI, it seems AI keeps pumping out big stories, one after the other.\\nSo, with 2024 right around the corner, here are three AI stocks worth owning in 2024 -- and beyond.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nAI analysis can help companies optimize their operations\\nJake Lerch (Palantir Technologies): With the stock up 178% year to date, 2023 has been an incredible year for Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and its shareholders. There are, however, signs that 2024 (and beyond) could be even better.\\nPalantir operates AI-based analytics systems for governmental and commercial uses and is on the leading edge of translating AI innovation into shareholder returns. Consider Palantir\\'s recent announcement that it is extending its long-standing partnership with UniCredit S.p.A., a major European bank.\\nIn its press release , Palantir noted that its signature Foundry operating system delivered material results for UniCredit. For example, in 2023, \"advanced analytics and propensity models in Foundry helped [UniCredit] generate a four-fold increase in customer redemption of protection products through better targeting.\"\\nIndeed, UniCredit is just one of many customers that is desperate to ramp up its use of AI to streamline its operations. In a Dec. 7, 2023 interview with Fox Business, Palantir co-founder and CEO Alex Karp said, \"We just can\\'t keep up with our product demand...We are just breaking at the seams in the U.S.\"\\nThe numbers certainly back that statement up. In its most recent quarter (the three months ending on Sept. 30, 2023), Palantir grew revenue by 17% year over year. Trailing-12-month revenue hit $2.1 billion, gross profit swelled to $1.7 billion, and free cash flow increased to $474 million.\\nPLTR Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\\nNevertheless, Palantir stock isn\\'t for everyone. Since the company is still early in its lifecycle, its stock will be volatile. Indeed, shares plummeted more than 84% from their all-time high between January 2021 and January 2023.\\nStill, for long-term, growth-oriented investors, Palantir is a name worth considering, given the soaring demand for its products and its improving fundamentals.\\nAI isn\\'t just about what you see; it\\'s about what you say and hear\\nJustin Pope (SoundHound AI): Much of the hype around AI has focused on large language models like ChatGPT, but there are other ways to use AI that investors may not be fully aware of. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) develops conversational AI, taking an audio input, such as someone voicing a question and responding with dialogue or action.\\nConversational AI has a lot of existing and potential use cases. SoundHound AI is used in restaurant and hospitality industries to take orders or make reservations. It\\'s in vehicles, smart devices, and appliances for voice assistance. In the future, the technology could find its way into healthcare, customer service, and more. SoundHound AI estimates a long-term potential addressable market of $160 billion.\\nAs a company, SoundHound AI is just getting started. It\\'s only done $38 million in revenue over the past 12 months, but analysts believe it will grow significantly. Estimates call for 50% revenue growth over the next two years. The company also recently announced an acquisition of SYNQ3 Restaurant Solutions, giving SoundHound access to a potential restaurant pipeline of 100,000 locations.\\nSoundHound AI is a risky stock because the business is so nascent. It\\'s burning cash every quarter, and there is only a year or so of cash on the balance sheet at this rate. Investors shouldn\\'t be shocked if the company issues new stock to raise funds. Conversely, the stock\\'s market cap is just $480 million. Investors could eventually be handsomely rewarded if SoundHound AI can become a leader in this massive (but underrated) niche within AI.\\nIt\\'s way too early to count out this \"AI-first\" company\\nWill Healy (Alphabet): The narrative in the AI space seems to have turned away from Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG).\\nIndeed, the rise of OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT seemed to catch Alphabet off guard, particularly as rival Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) forged an alliance with the research and development company. This gave users a reason to start using Microsoft\\'s search engine, Bing, and some began questioning the dominance of the Google search engine for the first time in several years.\\nHowever, Alphabet has responded with its own generative AI tool called Bard. While the tools offer similar results, Bard was first in producing more up-to-date results as it leverages Google\\'s search engine.\\nMoreover, the company has a long history with AI. Alphabet first used AI to correct spelling as early as 2001. The tools advanced from that point, so much so that Alphabet declared itself an \"AI first\" company in 2016.\\nFurthermore, investors should remember that Alphabet owns numerous companies, some of which could drive AI innovation. Earlier this year, it combined two of its AI companies into Google DeepMind. This subsidiary is a group of scientists, engineers, and others researching AI.\\nAlso, with the funding backing Google DeepMind, the company has a high probability of driving innovation. Alphabet claims almost $120 billion in liquidity, and it generated nearly $32 billion in free cash flow in the first nine months of 2023. This gives the company tremendous resources to develop AI-related products and the ability to purchase the innovation it cannot create.\\nSuch optionality gives investors fewer reasons to doubt Alphabet, and one has to wonder whether the sentiment against the Google parent was overblown. Despite the concerns of some, the stock has risen by more than 40% over the last 12 months.\\nGOOGL PE Ratio data by YCharts\\nAdditionally, the increase has taken its P/E ratio to 26. While not inexpensive, its P/E is lower than those of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Microsoft. That lower valuation could be an opportunity to buy this stock as it uses its AI knowledge base and vast resources to remain a force in the artificial intelligence industry.\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn\\'t one of them.

It has amassed assets over $368.80 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\\nWhy Large Cap Blend\\nLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.\\nBlend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.\\nCosts\\nInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.\\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.03%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.\\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.43%.\\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\\nEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 29.40% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.\\nLooking at individual holdings, Apple Inc. (AAPL) accounts for about 7.53% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN).\\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 30.44% of total assets under management.\\nPerformance and Risk\\nVOO seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Index before fees and expenses. The S&P 500 Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market.\\nThe ETF has added about 25.26% so far this year and it's up approximately 24.84% in the last one year (as of 12/19/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $346.17 and $435.54.\\nThe ETF has a beta of 1 and standard deviation of 17.49% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 507 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\\nAlternatives\\nVanguard S&P 500 ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VOO is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.\\nThe iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track the same index. While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $397.71 billion in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $456.74 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.\\nBottom-Line\\nWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.\\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\\nZacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.\\nGet it free >>\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It has amassed assets over $1.66 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Blend. QDF seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust Quality Dividend Index before fees and expenses.\\nThe Northern Trust Quality Dividend Index is designed to provide exposure to a high-quality income-oriented portfolio of long-only U.S. equity securities, with an emphasis on long-term capital growth and a targeted overall beta that is similar to that of the Northern Trust 1250 Index and the Index are selected based on expected dividend payment and fundamental factors.\\nCost & Other Expenses\\nExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.\\nAnnual operating expenses for QDF are 0.37%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.\\nQDF's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 2.19%.\\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\\nMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.\\nFor QDF, it has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector --about 31.40% of the portfolio --while Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.\\nLooking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 9.45% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp Common Stock Usd 0.00000625 (MSFT) and Procter &no.38; Gamble Co/the Common Stock Usd 0 (PG).\\nIts top 10 holdings account for approximately 34.12% of QDF's total assets under management.\\nPerformance and Risk\\nThe ETF return is roughly 19.10% so far this year and is up about 20.04% in the last one year (as of 12/19/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $51.86 and $61.93.\\nThe fund has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 16.04% for the trailing three-year period, which makes QDF a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 143 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\\nAlternatives\\nFlexShares Quality Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.\\nIShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT) tracks S&P Total Market Index and the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) tracks CRSP US Total Market Index. IShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF has $48.85 billion in assets, Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF has $344.19 billion. ITOT has an expense ratio of 0.03% and VTI charges 0.03%.\\nInvestors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - All Cap Blend.\\nBottom Line\\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\\nZacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.\\nGet it free >>\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ESG is managed by Flexshares. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the STOXX USA ESG Impact Index.\\nThe STOXX USA ESG Select KPIs Index is an optimized index designed to provide broad market exposure that is tilted toward U.S. companies that score better with respect to a small set of environmental, social and governance characteristics and to provide the potential for attractive risk-adjusted performance relative to the STOXX USA 900 Index.\\nCost & Other Expenses\\nInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.\\nWith on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.32%.\\nThe fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.11%.\\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\\nEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 25.80% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.\\nTaking into account individual holdings, Amazon.com Inc Common Stock Usd 0.01 (AMZN) accounts for about 5.14% of the fund's total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Microsoft Corp Common Stock Usd 0.00000625 (MSFT).\\nESG's top 10 holdings account for about 34.71% of its total assets under management.\\nPerformance and Risk\\nThe ETF return is roughly 26.91% so far this year and is up about 26.91% in the last one year (as of 12/19/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $90.43 and $115.26.\\nThe fund has a beta of 1.03 and standard deviation of 17.87% for the trailing three-year period.
